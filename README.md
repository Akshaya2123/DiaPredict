# Diabetes Prediction and Model Comparison App

This is an interactive **Streamlit** web application that:
1. **Visualizes** insights from a diabetes dataset.
2. **Compares multiple machine learning models** and displays their accuracy.
3. **Predicts whether a person is diabetic** based on user input.

## Features

### 1️ Data Visualization
- Explore different charts from the diabetes dataset.
- Click on a button to display the chosen visualization.
- Understand trends, correlations, and data distribution.

### 2️ Model Accuracy Comparison
- Trains and evaluates **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **SVM**, and **KNN**.
- Displays results in a **table** and a **bar chart**.
- Highlights the **best performing model** automatically.

### 3️ Diabetes Prediction
- A dedicated prediction page where the user inputs health parameters.
- Uses the trained best model to predict **Diabetic** or **Non-Diabetic**.
- Instant results with easy-to-understand interface.
